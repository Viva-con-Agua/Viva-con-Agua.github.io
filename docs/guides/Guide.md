# Guides

## Edit the documentation

This page is hosted using GitHub Pages and you can pull the project as repository. The page is implemented using react-static using the markdown template. Thus we can use markdown to write the documentation and React to present it.
Getting started

Pull the repository, add or edit a markdown file in docs/. Commit and post your changes to the repository and your changes will be visible on https://viva-con-agua.github.io/.
