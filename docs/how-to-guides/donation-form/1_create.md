# How to create an donation form with Factory

In order to be able to manage Viva con Agua's online donations, we maintain our own donation form. 
Each form gets its own ID and so it can be assigned to an campaign. This `donation_form_id` also determines other properties of the form.
For example the slider element or the default amount of an donation. 

A `donation_form_id` also refers to a specific company. This allows us to store the authentication information of the payment service providers in our backend.
