# Server Config & Orchestration

Currently, our servers are configured manually and without any form of central configuration management.

Nonetheless for the future we have an [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) repository at [viva-con-agua/ansible](https://github.com/Viva-con-Agua/ansible) which we sometimes use for new configuration.
How the ansible repository can be used to author and deploy changes is documented in the repository itself.
